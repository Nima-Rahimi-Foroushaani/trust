# tRust
tRust is a research tool for modular formal verification of Rust programs. tRust is a recursive name, diverges to "tRust Rust Rust ..." describing our goal; the possibility of calling tRust for any possible Rust program.
It relies on [VeriFast](https://github.com/verifast/verifast) method of modular formal verification using symbolic execution.

tRust is being developed mainly by Software Verification Team in [DistriNet](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/) Research Group at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/)
